2. Sign in to your Square Developer account
3. Select your Money Buddy application
4. Navigate to the **Production** environment (not Sandbox)

## Step 2: Configure Webhook Endpoint

### Production Webhook URL:
\`\`\`
https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/square
\`\`\`

2. Click **"Create Webhook Endpoint"**
3. Enter your production webhook URL
4. Select **"Production"** environment
5. Click **"Save"**

## Step 3: Subscribe to Events

Subscribe to these essential events for Money Buddy:

### Payment Events:
- ‚úÖ `payment.created` - When a payment is initiated
- ‚úÖ `payment.updated` - When payment status changes (completed/failed)

### Refund Events:
- ‚úÖ `refund.created` - When a refund is initiated
- ‚úÖ `refund.updated` - When refund status changes

### Dispute Events:
- ‚úÖ `dispute.created` - When a chargeback/dispute is filed

### How to Subscribe:
1. Click on your webhook endpoint
2. Click **"Event Types"** tab
3. Select the events listed above
4. Click **"Save Changes"**

## Step 4: Get Webhook Signature Key

1. In your webhook endpoint settings
2. Copy the **"Webhook Signature Key"**
3. Add it to your production environment variables:

\`\`\`env
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=your_production_webhook_signature_key_here
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Production Environment Variables

Update your production `.env` file with these Square settings:

\`\`\`env
# Square Production Configuration
SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=sq0idp-your-production-app-id
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAAAl_your_production_access_token
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=production
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=your_production_webhook_signature_key
\`\`\`

## Step 6: Test Webhook Integration

### Test with Real Payments:
1. Make a small test payment ($1.00) through Money Buddy
2. Check your application logs for webhook events
3. Verify payment status updates in your database

### Webhook Testing Tools:
- Use Square's webhook testing tool in the developer dashboard
- Monitor webhook delivery status and retry attempts
- Check webhook logs for any failures

## Step 7: Monitor Webhook Health

### Square Dashboard Monitoring:
1. Go to **Webhooks** ‚Üí **Your Endpoint**
2. Monitor **"Recent Deliveries"** tab
3. Check for failed deliveries or errors
4. Review retry attempts and success rates

### Application Monitoring:
\`\`\`javascript
// Add to your webhook handler for monitoring
console.log('Webhook received:', {
  type: event.type,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  paymentId: event.data?.object?.payment?.id
})
\`\`\`

## Webhook Event Handling

### Payment Created:
\`\`\`javascript
// When a customer makes a payment
case "payment.created":
  // Update user wallet balance
  // Send confirmation email
  // Create transaction record
  break
\`\`\`

### Payment Updated:
\`\`\`javascript
// When payment status changes
case "payment.updated":
  // Handle completed payments
  // Process failed payments
  // Update transaction status
  break
\`\`\`

### Refund Events:
\`\`\`javascript
// When refunds are processed
case "refund.created":
case "refund.updated":
  // Update user balance
  // Send refund notifications
  // Record refund transactions
  break
\`\`\`

## Security Best Practices

### Signature Verification:
- ‚úÖ Always verify webhook signatures
- ‚úÖ Use timing-safe comparison for signatures
- ‚úÖ Reject webhooks with invalid signatures

### HTTPS Requirements:
- ‚úÖ Webhook endpoints must use HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Valid SSL certificate required
- ‚úÖ No self-signed certificates

### Error Handling:
- ‚úÖ Return 200 status for successful processing
- ‚úÖ Return 4xx/5xx for errors (triggers retries)
- ‚úÖ Log all webhook events for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Webhook Not Receiving Events:**
- Verify webhook URL is correct and accessible
- Check that events are properly subscribed
- Ensure production environment is selected

**Signature Verification Failing:**
- Confirm webhook signature key is correct
- Check that signature header is being read properly
- Verify HMAC-SHA256 calculation

**Payment Processing Issues:**
- Check Square application permissions
- Verify production access token is valid
- Ensure payment amounts are in correct format (cents)

### Debug Steps:
1. Check function logs
2. Monitor Square webhook delivery status
3. Test webhook endpoint manually
4. Verify environment variables are set
