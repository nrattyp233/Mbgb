# Conditional Geo-Time Transfer System Architecture

## üß† Core Concept
A **conditional transfer system** where **location and time constraints** govern whether a transaction completes or reverses.

## üîÅ Transaction Flow

1. **User connects bank account** (via Stripe Financial Connections)
2. **User initiates a transfer** to another user
3. **User sets conditions**:
   - **Geo-fence**: Draw circle on map or enter address
   - **Time window**: e.g., "Recipient must be inside geo-fence within 2 hours"
4. **System holds funds temporarily** (via Stripe)
5. **Recipient location is tracked** (via GPS with consent)
6. **If recipient enters geo-fence within time window** ‚Üí funds released
7. **If not** ‚Üí funds returned to sender

## üß© Modular Architecture

### 1. Frontend Components
- **Map Interface**: Leaflet/Mapbox for drawing geo-fence
- **Transfer Form**: Set time window and recipient
- **Real-time Status**: Live transfer updates
- **Location Consent**: Clear privacy controls

### 2. Backend Services
- **Transfer Initiation Service**: Handle conditional transfers
- **Location Validation Service**: Check geo-fence compliance  
- **Time Window Service**: Monitor and enforce time limits
- **Payment Processing Service**: Stripe integration for holds/releases

### 3. Database Architecture
See `conditional-transfer-schema.sql` for detailed schema

### 4. Payment Integration
- **Stripe Connect/Treasury** for fund holding
- **PaymentIntent with manual capture** for conditional releases
- **Automated refunds** for failed conditions

## üõ°Ô∏è Legal Compliance Strategy

### Risk Mitigation
- **Not a bank**: Facilitating conditional transfers only
- **Stripe handles custody**: Full compliance delegation
- **Clear disclosures**: Transparent condition-based system
- **Time limits**: Prevent indefinite fund holding

### Required Disclosures
- "MoneyBuddy does not guarantee delivery unless conditions are met"
- "Funds returned if recipient fails to meet conditions"
- "Location tracking requires explicit consent"
- "Service fees may apply for failed transfers"

## üöÄ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP
- Basic geo-fence (circle only)
- Simple time windows (hours)
- Manual location updates

### Phase 2: Enhanced
- Complex geo-fences (polygons)
- Smart time windows (business hours)
- Automatic location tracking

### Phase 3: Advanced
- Multiple conditions (AND/OR logic)
- Recurring conditional transfers
- AI-powered location prediction
