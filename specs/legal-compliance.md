# Legal & Compliance Framework for Conditional Transfers

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Core Legal Position
**MoneyBuddy is NOT a bank or money transmitter** - we are a **conditional transfer facilitator** that:
- Connects users to licensed financial institutions (Stripe)
- Facilitates conditional transfers based on user-defined criteria
- Does not hold, store, or custody funds directly

### Regulatory Compliance

#### 1. Money Transmitter Exemptions
**Safe Harbor Positioning**:
- ‚úÖ **Technology Provider**: We provide the platform, Stripe handles money
- ‚úÖ **Agent Model**: Acting as technology agent for Stripe's licensed services
- ‚úÖ **No Float**: Funds never touch our accounts - direct bank-to-bank via Stripe
- ‚úÖ **No Currency Exchange**: USD-to-USD transfers only
- ‚úÖ **Clear Intermediary Role**: Transparent about Stripe partnership

#### 2. Required Licenses & Registrations
- **MSB Registration**: Register as Money Services Business with FinCEN
- **State Licenses**: Check requirements in operating states (varies by state)
- **Stripe Partnership**: Leverage Stripe's existing licenses and compliance

## üìã Required Disclosures & Terms

### 1. Service Agreement Terms

```markdown
## Conditional Transfer Service Terms

**Service Description**: MoneyBuddy facilitates conditional money transfers where funds are released only when recipient meets sender-defined location and time requirements.

**Key Terms**:
- MoneyBuddy is NOT a bank, credit union, or financial institution
- All funds are processed and held by Stripe, Inc. (licensed money transmitter)
- Transfers are conditional - funds may be returned if conditions not met
- Location tracking requires explicit recipient consent
- Service fees apply regardless of transfer completion status

**Risk Disclosures**:
- Funds may be returned to sender if conditions are not met
- Technical failures may delay or prevent condition verification
- Location accuracy depends on device/GPS capabilities
- Time limits are strictly enforced - no extensions available
```

### 2. Privacy Notice - Location Data

```markdown
## Location Privacy Notice

**Data Collection**: We collect precise location data only when:
- You are a recipient of a conditional transfer
- You have explicitly consented to location tracking
- An active conditional transfer requires location verification

**Data Usage**:
- Location data is used ONLY to verify geofence conditions
- Data is automatically deleted 30 days after transfer completion
- Data is never sold or shared with third parties
- You can revoke location consent at any time (may cause transfer failure)

**Your Rights**:
- Access your location data
- Request deletion of location history
- Opt-out of location services (may affect service functionality)
```

### 3. Fee Schedule

```markdown
## Fee Structure

**Conditional Transfer Fees**:
- Platform Fee: 1.5% of transfer amount
- Stripe Processing Fee: 2.9% + $0.30
- Failed Condition Fee: $2.00 (covers processing costs)
- Refund Processing: Free

**Example**: $100 transfer
- You pay: $104.70 total
- Recipient receives: $95.41 (if conditions met)
- Your refund: $95.41 (if conditions not met, minus $2 fee)
```

## üîí User Consent Framework

### 1. Multi-Layer Consent System

```typescript
interface UserConsent {
  // Basic service consent
  termsOfService: {
    accepted: boolean;
    version: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  
  // Financial services consent
  financialServices: {
    stripeDataSharing: boolean;
    conditionalTransfers: boolean;
    feeAcknowledgment: boolean;
  };
  
  // Location privacy consent
  locationServices: {
    preciseLocation: boolean;
    backgroundLocation: boolean;
    dataRetention: boolean;
    thirdPartySharing: boolean; // Always false for us
  };
  
  // Communication consent
  notifications: {
    transferUpdates: boolean;
    securityAlerts: boolean;
    marketing: boolean;
  };
}
```

### 2. Consent Verification Flow

```typescript
async function verifyConditionalTransferConsent(userId: string): Promise<boolean> {
  const consent = await getUserConsent(userId);
  
  const requiredConsents = [
    consent.termsOfService.accepted,
    consent.financialServices.conditionalTransfers,
    consent.financialServices.feeAcknowledgment,
    consent.locationServices.preciseLocation
  ];
  
  return requiredConsents.every(Boolean);
}
```

## üìä Compliance Monitoring

### 1. Transaction Monitoring

```sql
-- Suspicious activity monitoring
CREATE VIEW suspicious_transfers AS
SELECT 
  sender_id,
  recipient_id,
  COUNT(*) as transfer_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_amount,
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date
FROM conditional_transfers 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY sender_id, recipient_id, DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 OR SUM(amount) > 10000; -- Flag high volume

-- Failed condition analysis
CREATE VIEW failed_condition_analysis AS
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as total_transfers,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'expired' THEN 1 END) as expired_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'released' THEN 1 END) as successful_count,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'expired' THEN 1 END)::numeric / 
    COUNT(*)::numeric * 100, 2
  ) as failure_rate_percent
FROM conditional_transfers
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### 2. Automated Compliance Checks

```typescript
/**
 * Daily compliance checks
 */
async function runComplianceChecks() {
  const checks = await Promise.all([
    checkSuspiciousActivity(),
    verifyKYCCompliance(),
    auditLocationConsent(),
    validateFeeCalculations(),
    checkDataRetentionCompliance()
  ]);
  
  const failedChecks = checks.filter(check => !check.passed);
  
  if (failedChecks.length > 0) {
    await alertComplianceTeam(failedChecks);
  }
  
  return {
    timestamp: new Date(),
    totalChecks: checks.length,
    passedChecks: checks.filter(c => c.passed).length,
    failedChecks: failedChecks.length,
    details: checks
  };
}
```

## üö® Incident Response Plan

### 1. Data Breach Response
1. **Immediate**: Stop data collection, secure systems
2. **24 hours**: Assess scope, notify legal team
3. **72 hours**: Notify affected users and regulators if required
4. **Ongoing**: Remediation, improved security measures

### 2. Financial Compliance Issues
1. **Immediate**: Suspend affected transactions
2. **Investigation**: Work with Stripe and legal team
3. **Resolution**: Implement fixes, report to regulators
4. **Prevention**: Update processes and monitoring

### 3. Location Privacy Violations
1. **Immediate**: Stop location collection for affected users
2. **Notification**: Inform users within 24 hours
3. **Deletion**: Remove improperly collected data
4. **Process Update**: Strengthen consent mechanisms

## üìã Regulatory Reporting

### 1. Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs)
- Monitor for patterns indicating money laundering
- File SARs with FinCEN within required timeframes
- Maintain detailed records of all flagged activities

### 2. Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)
- Although unlikely with geo-transfers, monitor for large amounts
- File CTRs for transactions > $10,000 in a single day

### 3. Record Keeping Requirements
- Maintain all transaction records for 5 years
- Store user identification and verification documents
- Keep audit trail of all system changes and access
