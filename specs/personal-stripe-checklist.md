# Personal Stripe Integration Checklist

## üîß Stripe Account Setup

### 1. Account Configuration
- [ ] Upgrade to **Stripe Business Account** (if not already)
- [ ] Enable **Payment Intents** for conditional holds
- [ ] Set up **Webhooks** for real-time status updates
- [ ] Configure **Customer Portal** for user management

### 2. API Keys Setup
```bash
# Add to .env.local
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_... # or pk_test_ for testing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... # or sk_test_ for testing
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Webhook Endpoints
Configure these events in Stripe Dashboard:

- `payment_intent.canceled`
- `subscription.created` (for locked savings)
- `subscription.updated`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`

## üí≥ Payment Processing Implementation

### 1. Conditional Transfer Flow
```typescript
// File: /lib/stripe-personal.ts
export async function createConditionalTransfer(data: {
  amount: number;
  senderEmail: string;
  recipientEmail: string;
  geofence: GeofenceData;
  timeLimit: Date;
}) {
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: Math.round(data.amount * 100), // Convert to cents
    currency: 'usd',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    capture_method: 'manual', // Don't capture until conditions met
    metadata: {
      type: 'conditional_transfer',
      sender_email: data.senderEmail,
      recipient_email: data.recipientEmail,
      geofence_lat: data.geofence.lat.toString(),
      geofence_lng: data.geofence.lng.toString(),
      geofence_radius: data.geofence.radius.toString(),
      expires_at: data.timeLimit.toISOString(),
      platform_fee: Math.round(data.amount * 0.01 * 100), // 1% fee
    },
  });
  
  return paymentIntent;
}
```

### 2. Locked Savings Implementation  
```typescript
export async function createLockedSavings(data: {
  userId: string;
  amount: number;
  durationMonths: number;
  interestRate: number;
}) {
  // Create one-time payment for the lock amount
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: Math.round(data.amount * 100),
    currency: 'usd',
    payment_method_types: ['card'],
    metadata: {
      type: 'locked_savings',
      user_id: data.userId,
      lock_duration_months: data.durationMonths.toString(),
      interest_rate: data.interestRate.toString(),
      unlock_date: new Date(Date.now() + data.durationMonths * 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString(),
    },
  });
  
  return paymentIntent;
}
```

## üè¶ Fund Management Strategy

### 1. Segregated Account Structure
```
Your Personal Stripe Account
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Operating Balance (for immediate operations)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transfer Hold Pool (conditional transfers waiting)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Savings Pool (locked savings deposits)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Interest Reserve (funds for paying savings interest)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Fee Revenue (platform earnings)
```

### 2. Fund Flow Management
```typescript
// Track different fund pools in your database
interface FundPools {
  operating_balance: number;
  transfer_holds: number;
  locked_savings: number;
  interest_reserve: number;
  fee_revenue: number;
}

// Update pools when transactions occur
async function updateFundPools(transactionType: string, amount: number) {
  // Implementation to track fund allocation
}
```

---

## üìä Revenue & Fee Structure

### 1. Platform Fees
```typescript
const FEE_STRUCTURE = {
  // Conditional transfers
  transfer_fee_percentage: 0.029, // 2.9% to cover Stripe + margin
  transfer_fee_fixed: 30, // $0.30 fixed fee
  failed_transfer_fee: 100, // $1.00 for failed transfers
  
  // Locked savings
  savings_management_fee: 0.005, // 0.5% annual management fee
  early_withdrawal_penalties: {
    '3_months': 0.01,  // 1%
    '6_months': 0.015, // 1.5%
    '9_months': 0.02,  // 2%
    '12_months': 0.025 // 2.5%
  },
  
  // Interest rates offered to users
  savings_interest_rates: {
    '3_months': 0.025,  // 2.5% APY
    '6_months': 0.030,  // 3.0% APY
    '9_months': 0.035,  // 3.5% APY
    '12_months': 0.040  // 4.0% APY
  }
};
```

### 2. Cost Coverage Analysis
```typescript
// Example: $100 conditional transfer
const transfer_amount = 10000; // $100.00 in cents
const stripe_fee = Math.round(transfer_amount * 0.029 + 30); // $3.20
const platform_margin = Math.round(transfer_amount * 0.01); // $1.00
const total_fee = stripe_fee + platform_margin; // $4.20
const net_to_recipient = transfer_amount - total_fee; // $95.80

// Your revenue: $1.00 per successful transfer
// Covers: servers, compliance, development, profit
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Compliance Requirements

### 1. Terms of Service Updates
```markdown
## Fund Custody
MoneyBuddy facilitates payments using Stripe. During conditional transfers, 
funds are temporarily held in the service provider's Stripe account until 
conditions are met or expired.

## Not a Bank
MoneyBuddy is not a bank or financial institution. We do not provide 
banking services. Locked savings are not FDIC insured.

## Location Services
GPS location is used solely to verify geofence conditions for transfers. 
Location data is not stored or used for other purposes.
```

### 2. Privacy Policy Updates
```markdown
## Location Data
We collect location data only when you participate in geofence transfers.
This data is used exclusively for verifying transfer conditions and is 
deleted after transfer completion.

## Payment Information
Payment processing is handled by Stripe. We do not store full payment 
card information on our servers.
```

### 3. Business Registration
- [ ] Register business in your state (if not already)
- [ ] Check money transmitter license requirements
- [ ] Consult lawyer for compliance review
- [ ] Set up business bank account for operations
