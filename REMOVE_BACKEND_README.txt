The following backend files were removed as part of the migration to Supabase:
- lib/neon.ts
- app/api/geofences/route.ts
- app/api/setup-database/route.ts
- app/api/setup-neon-tables/route.ts
- app/api/test-neon-connection/route.ts
- app/api/test-neon-database/route.ts

You can now implement your new Supabase backend logic in the appropriate API routes and libraries.
